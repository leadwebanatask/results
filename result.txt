Task 1. Floats.

1.a Please explain why this code `console.log(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);` outputs `false` in console? 

False result is caused by floating accuracy problems which were well described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems
so 0.1 + 0.2 should be equal to 0.3 but console.log(0.1 + 0.2) outputs: 0.30000000000000004
in that case 0.30000000000000004 is not equal 0.3 



1.b Please suggest fix to make this expression working as expected.

JavaScript introduced toFixed function which returns string value with specified number of decimals.
ref: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_tofixed.asp
Also there is casting function called parseFloat.
ref: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parsefloat.asp

below code will solve the issue. 
Also please notice that parseFloat is not mandatory
(in that case == will return true, but === will return false caused by different data types)
console.log( parseFloat( (0.1 + 0.2).toFixed(5)  ) === parseFloat((0.3).toFixed(5)) )
